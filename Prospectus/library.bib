abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 SPIE.There is currently an interest in developing mobile sensing platforms that fly indoors. The primary goal for these platforms is to be able to successfully navigate a building under various lighting and environmental conditions. There are numerous research challenges associated with this goal, one of which is the platform's ability to detect and identify the presence of transparent barriers. Transparent barriers could include windows, glass partitions, or skylights. For example, in order to successfully navigate inside of a structure, these platforms will need to sense if a space contains a transparent barrier and whether or not this space can be traversed. This project's focus has been developing a multimodal sensing system that can successfully identify such transparent barriers under various lighting conditions while aboard a mobile platform. Along with detecting transparent barriers, this sensing platform is capable of distinguishing between reflective, opaque, and transparent barriers. It will be critical for this system to be able to identify transparent barriers in real-time in order for the navigation system to maneuver accordingly. The properties associated with the interaction between various frequencies of light and transparent materials were one of the techniques leveraged to solve this problem.},

abstract = {In many relevant path planning problems, loop closure constraints reduce$\backslash$nthe configuration space to a manifold embedded in the higher-dimensional$\backslash$njoint ambient space. Whereas many progresses have been done to solve path planning$\backslash$nproblems in the presence of obstacles, only few work consider loop closure$\backslash$nconstraints. In this paper, we present the AtlasRRT algorithm, a planner specially$\backslash$ntailored for such constrained systems that builds on recently developed tools for$\backslash$nhigher-dimensional continuation. These tools provide procedures to define charts$\backslash$nthat locally parametrize manifolds and to coordinate them forming an atlas. Atlas-$\backslash$nRRT simultaneously builds an atlas and a Rapidly-Exploring Random Tree (RRT),$\backslash$nusing the atlas to sample relevant configurations for the RRT, and the RRT to devise$\backslash$ndirections of expansion for the atlas. The advantage of the new planner comes from$\backslash$nthat samples obtained from the atlas allow a more efficient extension of the RRT$\backslash$nas compared to state of the art approaches where samples are generated in the joint$\backslash$nambient space.},

abstract = {In this work we present a visual servoing approach that enables a humanoid robot to robustly execute dual arm grasping and manipulation tasks. Therefore the target object(s) and both hands are tracked alternately and a combined open-/ closed-loop controller is used for positioning the hands with respect to the target(s). We address the perception system and how the observable workspace can be increased by using an active vision system on a humanoid head. Furthermore a control framework for reactive positioning of both hands using position based visual servoing is presented, where the sensor data streams coming from the vision system, the joint encoders and the force/torque sensors are fused and joint velocity values are generated. This framework can be used for bimanual grasping as well as for two handed manipulations which is demonstrated with the humanoid robot Armar-III that executes grasping and manipulation tasks in a kitchen environment.},

abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of optimal grasping of an object with a multi-fingered robotic hand for accomplishing a given task. The task is first demonstrated by a human operator and its force/torque requirements are captured through the usage of a sensorized tool. The grasp quality is computed through a task compatibility criterion. Grasp synthesis is then formulated as a single constrained optimization problem, generating grasps that are feasible for the hand's kinematics by maximizing the corresponding task-oriented quality criterion and ensuring grasp stability. The method was validated on a human hand model and is shown to be easily adapted to different hand kinematic models.},

abstract = {Recent advances in both anthropomorphic robots and bimanual industrial manipulators had led to an increased interest in the specific problems pertaining to dual arm manipulation. For the future, we foresee robots performing human-like tasks in both domestic and industrial settings. It is therefore natural to study specifics of dual arm manipulation in humans and methods for using the resulting knowledge in robot control. The related scientific problems range from low-level control to high level task planning and execution. This review aims to summarize the current state of the art from the heterogenous range of fields that study the different aspects of these problems specifically in dual arm manipulation.},
annote = {A future direction in robotic systems in general, and in dual arm manipulation in particular, will be the integration of elements from systems theory with tools from cognitive methodologies. These will involve the consideration of vision and learning capabilities in the actual feedback design. This seems necessary in advanced collaborative control tasks where the manipulators have incomplete knowledge of the environment, and might have been assigned their tasks independently. In particular, the lack of global knowledge about the environment and the final objective of the task in hand, along with the limitations in coordination due to sensing and communication constraints, suggest the integration of cognitive features in order to modify the individual agent controllers in an on-line data-driven manner. Future research will thus build, among others, towards the integration of the different research features addressed in this paper in order to address complex coordinated tasks.},

abstract = {In robotic manipulation systems, a dual-arm configuration is needed for complex operations, like unscrewing a container, and can be useful for load sharing and manipulation of heavy and bulky objects. The potential of dual arm manipulation has recently also been identified for industrial pro-duction setups. We discuss how to coordinate such a system using impedance control. A two-arm control law consisting of a set of impedance subsystems is presented. The elasticity in the joints is handled within a singular per-turbations based approach. Separate Cartesian impedance controllers for the arms are combined with a compatible coupling impedance. Then, an object level control law for the arms is discussed. The control architecture is briefly discussed. As a non-trivial example, the acquisition of a flat object from a table with grasping points that could not be achieved with a standard two-jaw gripper is demonstrated. The robustness of the execution is increased by sliding along the table during the grasping phase.},

abstract = {This paper discusses cooperative control of a dual-flexible-arm robot to handle a rigid object in three-dimensional space. The proposed control scheme integrates hybrid position/force control and vibration suppression control. To derive the control scheme, kinematics and dynamics of the robot when it forms a closed kinematic chain is discussed. Kinematics is described using workspace force, velocity and position vectors, and hybrid position/force control is extended from that on dual-rigid-arm robots. Dynamics is derived from constraint conditions and the lumped-mass-spring model of the flexible robots and an object. The vibration suppression control is calculated from the deflections of the flexible links and the dynamics. Experiments on cooperative control are performed. The absolute positions/orientations and internal forces/moments are controlled using the robot, each arm of which has two flexible links, seven joints and a force/torque sensor. The results illustrate that the robot handled the rigid object damping links' vibration successfully in three-dimensional space.},

abstract = {When multiple arms are used to manipulate a large object, it is$\backslash$nbeneficial and sometimes necessary to maintain and control contacts$\backslash$nbetween the object and the effector (the contacting surface of an arm)$\backslash$nthrough force closure. Rolling and/or sliding can occur at these$\backslash$ncontacts, and the system is, in general, characterized by holonomic as$\backslash$nwell as nonholonomic (including unilateral) constraints. In this paper,$\backslash$nthe control of planar rolling contacts is investigated. Multi-arm$\backslash$nmanipulation systems are typically redundant. In the authors' approach,$\backslash$na minimal set of inputs is employed to control the trajectory of the$\backslash$nsystem while the surplus inputs control the contact conditions. The$\backslash$ntrajectory includes the gross motion of the object as well as the$\backslash$nrolling motion at each contact. A nonlinear feedback scheme for$\backslash$nsimultaneous control of motion as well as contact conditions is$\backslash$npresented. A new algorithm which adapts a two-effector grasp with$\backslash$nrolling contacts to external loads and the trajectory is developed.$\backslash$nSimulations and experimental results are used to illustrate the salient$\backslash$nfeatures in control and planning},

abstract = {Dexterous multi-fingered hands can accomplish fine manipulation behaviors that are infeasible with simple robotic grippers. However, sophisticated multi-fingered hands are often expensive and fragile. Low-cost soft hands offer an appealing alternative to more conventional devices, but present considerable challenges in sensing and actuation, making them difficult to apply to more complex manipulation tasks. In this paper, we describe an approach to learning from demonstration that can be used to train soft robotic hands to perform dexterous manipulation tasks. Our method uses object-centric demonstrations, where a human demonstrates the desired motion of manipulated objects with their own hands, and the robot autonomously learns to imitate these demonstrations using reinforcement learning. We propose a novel algorithm that allows us to blend and select a subset of the most feasible demonstrations to learn to imitate on the hardware, which we use with an extension of the guided policy search framework to use multiple demonstrations to learn generalizable neural network policies. We demonstrate our approach on the RBO Hand 2, with learned motor skills for turning a valve, manipulating an abacus, and grasping.},

Curvature-based methods are developed for constructing tangent bundle approximations, and procedures for random node generation and bidirectional tree extension are developed that significantly reduce the number of projections to the manifold. Extensive numerical experiments for a wide range of planning problems demonstrate the computational advantages of the TB-RRT algorithm over existing constrained path planning algorithms.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},
